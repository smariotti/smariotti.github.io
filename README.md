# Trophy Hunt Leaderboard redirector site

This is a Github Pages repo, that just has an index.html that will redirect to a Replit website that displays the leaderboard.

If you use the free version of Replit, it creates a bonkers-crazy URL that people can use to view the site. This URL changes every time you run your Replit app, but is stable within a given run. This github.io Pages site just provides a stable URL I can redirect from to get to the Replit URL generated when I run the app in Replit.
